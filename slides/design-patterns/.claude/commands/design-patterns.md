I am teaching this design pattern: #$ARGUMENTS

In @examples folder, make a subfolder named with that design pattern. Inside that, make two files 00-bad.py and 00-good.py. 00-bad.py is a bad examples without the pattern. The 00-good.py is the one with the pattern, which should be better. Make them as simple as possible, but should be adequate to explain the essense of an the pattern

Also, make a file named 00-animation.html to animate/visualize the pattern. Use GSAP for that

If there are already files there, make a new one with new numbering (e.g., 01-bad.py, 01-good.py).

The examples are in Python.
