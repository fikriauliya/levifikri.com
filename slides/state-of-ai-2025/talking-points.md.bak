## General Panel Theme: Intergenerational AI: Ethics and Education

Amidst the explosion of artificial intelligence (AI), a worrying generation gap in understanding has emerged. Older adults often feel uncertain: a global UNESCO survey (2023) shows that 7 out of 10 older adults find AI "too abstract," while a study in Indonesia (Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology, 2024) found that 74% avoid AI-based technology due to distrust and technical difficulties. They worry that AI erodes human interaction (82%) and is vulnerable to manipulation by automated systems.

Conversely, young people tend to view AI as a routine tool: 89% of Indonesian students use ChatGPT for school assignments, but only 33% understand its ethical risks (e.g., data bias or deepfakes). A Nature study (2024) warns of the phenomenon of digital overconfidence: young people are skilled at operating AI, but have little awareness of its social impactsâ€”such as privacy violations of the elderly or the spread of misinformation.

This disparity is exacerbated by generationally biased AI design:

- 92% of AI training datasets are sourced from youth content (MIT Tech Review, 2024).
- Only 1 in 10 AI applications consider the needs of the elderly (OECD, 2023).

As a result, AI is not bridging the gap but deepening isolation. The elderly are increasingly left behind, while young people lose the perspective of intergenerational wisdom.

Collaboration is urgently needed to ensure AI does not become a tool of fragmentation but a unifier of civilization. The focus of this panel is divided into three areas:

- Bridging the AI technology gap between generations
- Artificial Intelligence for educational activities
- The impact of artificial intelligence in the realm of ethics

## Conference Objectives

1. Facilitate the exchange of knowledge about the ability of the elderly to deal with digital fraud, hoaxes, and digital literacy in general.
2. Empower future first-time voters with healthy discussions to deal with misleading politics on the election timeline
3. Discuss the significance of AI for the younger generation, particularly in understanding the ethical and educational aspects of AI in life.
4. Build a collaborative network among stakeholders related to the above themes.
5. Generate policy/practice recommendations that impact Indonesia.

## Target Participants

Target audience, both offline and online (hybrid):

- Researchers, academics, and practitioners in the fields of digital literacy, communication, and AI
- Government representatives, NGOs, and international organizations
- Technology platforms and industry players
- Graduate students
- Media
- Communities

## My Talking Points

How can adaptive Al tutors be most effectively designed and implemented to provide truly personalized learning experiences for Indonesian students, considering diverse learning styles and regional contexts?

- What concrete strategies can be employed to mitigate socioeconomic gaps in Al access and ensure equitable opportunities for all Indonesian students to benefit from Al in education?
- What is the critical role of parental involvement in successfully integrating Al-driven education into the Indonesian schooling system, and what challenges might arise?
- What are the significant content moderation challenges posed by generative Al in educational settings, particularly in a culturally diverse context like Indonesia?
- How can robust user feedback loops be established and utilized to ensure the ethical development and continuous improvement of ed-tech solutions incorporating Al in
  Indonesia?
