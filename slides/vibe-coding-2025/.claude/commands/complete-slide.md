Embed:

- For each `<!-- Embed: -->` comment in #$ARGUMENTS, create an HTML file in the `@animations` folder
- The animation should loop continuously and autoplay on load
- Use the GSAP library for all animations
- Embed the HTML file directly in the markdown below each comment (preserve the original comment)

Example:

- For each `<!-- Example: -->` comment, expand it with a list of relevant examples
- The examples should be inserted directly in the markdown below each comment (preserve the original comment)
